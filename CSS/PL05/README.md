## Bootstrap Template Replica

### CSS Project

This project was given to me to replicate [this](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/blog/) bootstrap template.

This was my first "big" CSS project as it took me a lot of weeks to finish it.

It was a great experience as I learned a lot of new things and I got to practice a lot of CSS.
